  <title>Whole Stream Routes - Generation 9</title>
  <abstract>This dataset provides a representation of the watercourses within the Oregon portion of the Columbia basin as well as coastal and Great Basin watersheds. A selected subset of streams were originally derived from the Framework hydrography dataset and include all records originally present within the 1:100,000 scale PNW Hydrography dataset, named 1:24,000 scale streams and unnamed 1:24,000 scale streams where ODFW managed aquatic resource information exist. The data were migrated to events on NHD between 2012 and 2014. Whole stream route events were synchronized to April 2017 NHD geometry from April through June 2017.

The primary purpose of this dataset is to map the location of complete streams and rivers and to maintain a unique ID associated with "whole streams". It serves as a template for storing aquatic resource information as linear referenced events and publishing to a human readable format. This dataset is maintained as events on the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and is derived from April 2017 NHD geometry.

This dataset is a derivation of the Oregon Hydrography water courses dataset which in turn is a derivation of the Pacific Northwest Framework Hydrography water courses dataset.</abstract>

  <history>This dataset originated from the 1:100,000 PNW River Reach files which were migrated to the Oregon Hydrography Framework dataset. From there, all other named, 1:24,000 scale Framework streams were added as were other stream features where ODFW had either fish habitat distribution or fish passage barrier information. In 2014, ODFW's mixed scale hydrography dataset was migrated to the NHD and is now referred to as the "Whole Stream Routes" dataset.</history>

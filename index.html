    <p>This is a demonstration of the leaflet web map library to create a thematic map using
        a custom tile set from Mapbox
    </p>

    <p class="title">Smith River Study Areas and Streams </p>
    <div class ='map' id="dotmap"></div> <!--creates a div for my map-->
   
    <script src="js\scripts.js"></script> <!--links to my js file-->

    <p>
        I wanted to experiment with a "dark mode" inspired map elements theme. I have
        chosen a dark background color for the page, as well as styled my popups, legend,
        and basemap layer selector to map for a cohesive theme. <br/><br/> I wanted the colors 
        for the geojson layers to be bright enough to separate from the custom mapbox tileset
        (which had colors chosen from a photo of my study site), but I find they turned out a
        little too bright and I'm not entirely thrilled with them. <br/><br/> I also tried styling the native
        leaflet zoom buttons, but couldn't get it to work :(
